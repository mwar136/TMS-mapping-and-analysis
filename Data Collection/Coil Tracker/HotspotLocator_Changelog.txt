Changelog:

26/11/2015
OMEGADF- change classname to coil_calibration
Include load_logging method from PolarisDragonfly
unbias_ft becomes create_storage
setup_dragonfly uses mm_ip instead of server
Add user_start_calibrate method
rezero method renamed vector
vector outputs mean of orientations and positions for coil and calibration plate
vector prints calculated vector
vector and coil_ori become objects
process_message recieves POLARIS_POSITION
process_message creates positions and orientation arrays
process_message removes sample number from array
create_storage is called from User_start_calibrate
Replaces load_config method with PolarisDragonfly corresponding method
Added config 'main' information to load_config... Do we need a n_tool variable? Does the polaris output a list of tools is can currently see?
Log file saves to coil_calibration log file
setup_polaris_interface not called as method currently
setup_dragonfly may need subscriptions added for Polaris_Position?
Removed UR5 movement messages and commands

27/11/2015
Added a calculation in process_message to find the hospot position for each sample Probably doesn't work curently
Changed vector to make_calibration_vector
Now subscribing to POLARIS_POSITION
Reorganized to improve readability
Renaming of some variables to improve readability... ongoing

30/11/2015
Added ntools data member
Simplified calculations loops in process_message



What needs changing in process_message after #calculating outputs?
What adjustments need to be made to get_ft_vals_from_DAQ_DATA_buffer?
What is __name__ == "__main__" doing in this instance, does anything need changing?
Do we need a seperate function to do calculation or should this sit within process message to occur if unbias = False
