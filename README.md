## Introduction
This repository contains the custom software used in the experimentation and data for the Bachelor of Science (Honours) dissertation title "Does Co-activation Preferentially Modulate Excitability of Overlapping Muscle Map Regions?".

The analysis software used the Dragonfly messaging system (http://dragonfly-msg.org/) to communicate data in real time between the software modules.
